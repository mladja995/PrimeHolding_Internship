SugarHigh - Explanation

-When you run the program, first you need to enter a number of candies.
Program checks if entered value satisfies the given boundiries, and checks does the value is string or number. 
If that isn't the case, program want let you to continue until you entered a regular value.

-When you entered a regular value for the number of candies, now you need to enter a sugar value for each candie.
Program checks if entered value satisfies the given boundiries, and checks does the value is string or number. 
If that isn't the case, program want let you to continue until you entered a regular value.

-When you entered a sugar value for each candie, now you need to enter a value for treshold.
Program checks if entered value satisfies the given boundiries, and checks does the value is string or number. 
If that isn't the case, program want let you to continue until you entered a regular value.

-When you done with all input data, program finds indices of candies wich you can eat without passing a treshold.

How does program do that?
-I created array of candies and one more array wich I called sortedCandies, wich has same elements like array candies.
-Then I sorted array sortedCandies in ascending order with algorithm merge sort.
-Now I can go through the sortedCandies array and sum the values of sugar until I pass a treshold, this is how I can
find the number of candies wich you can eat, wich represents the length of array indicesOfCandies.
-When I'm done with that, now I need to find the indices of candies and put it in array indicesOfCandies.
-However, I lost the true indicies of candies wich you can consume when I sorted array of candies.
-In order to find true indicies, I have two for loops, the boundire for the first loop is a number of candies wich you can eat,
we've find it earlier, now I am comparing elements from sortedCandies array with elements in candies array until I find the
matching, when I find a matching I have original index of element and I put it in array indicesOfCandies.
-Then I sort array indicesOfCandies with merge sort algorithm in ascending order and print them.
